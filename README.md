### Crud System

The "Crud System" is a Python application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a MongoDB backend for data storage. Using the Tkinter library, the system features a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the database.

Key Features:

- Create: Add new records to the database.
- Read: View existing records.
- Update: Modify existing data.
- Delete: Remove records from the database.

This integration with MongoDB ensures persistent data storage.
